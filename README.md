# 📸 PHOTO TIME

**STOP SCROLLING.**

You just stumbled upon the sickest digital photobooth on the web. No cap.

We didn't just build a "web app." We built a **Time Machine**. A portal. A vibe.
We took the soul of those old-school mall photobooths—the smell of ozone, the clunky curtains, the anticipation—and we injected it straight into the DOM.

## 🚀 WHAT IS THIS?

It's **PHOTO TIME**.
It's a fully immersive, browser-based photobooth experience that feels so real you'll try to put a quarter in your USB port.

*   **VIBES:** Retro-Modern-Teal-Awesomeness.
*   **TECH:** Pure, unadulterated HTML/CSS/JS. No bloated frameworks. No heavy libraries. Just raw code and magic.
*   **SECURITY:** **Locked. Down.** We enabled some serious "Don't Touch My Stuff" protocols. Try to right-click. I dare you.

## 🔥 FEATURES THAT SLAP

*   **Hyper-Realistic Design:** We physically modeled a booth with CSS. Shadows? Real. Curtains? Flowy. Printer slot? It actually spits out your photos.
*   **Zero-Trust Security:** We barred the windows and locked the doors. Anti-inspect, anti-snoop, anti-everything. Your session is YOUR session.
*   **Instant Prints:** Generates high-res strips instantly. Download 'em, share 'em, tape 'em to your digital locker.
*   **Mobile Ready:** Fits in your pocket better than a fidget spinner.

## 🛠️ HOW TO RUN IT

1.  Clone this repo.
2.  Open `index.html`.
3.  **POSE.**

That's it. It's statically perfect.
